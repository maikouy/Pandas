Pandas Challenge

PyCity Schools

Python Pandas script to analyze the district-wide standardized test results using a student dataset called Student_complete.csv and a school dataset called Schools_complete.csv. The student dataset consists of 7 columns: Student Id, Student Name, Student Gender, Student Grade, Student School Name, Student Reading Score and Student Math score. The school’s dataset consists of 5 columns: School ID, School Name, School Size, and School Budget. Overall, the data findings will showcase trends in each school on their academic performance. These trends will assist the school board members and the mayor in decisions making regarding future school budgets and priorities. 

Thus, create a Python Pandas script to calculate each of the following:

•District Summary

Create a table of the district's key metrics showcasing:
Total Schools, Total Students, Total Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Student’s Passing Math
      
•School Summary

Create a table of the school's key metrics showcasing:
Total Schools, School Types, Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Student’s Passing Math, % Student’s Passing Reading, % Students Passing Math & Reading
 
•Top Performing Schools

Create a table of the top 5 school's key metrics showcasing:
School Name, School Type, Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Student’s Passing Math, % Student’s Passing Reading, % Students Passing Math & Reading
      
•Bottom Performing Schools

Create a table of the bottom 5 school's key metrics showcasing:
School Name, School Type, Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Student’s Passing Math, % Student’s Passing Reading, % Students Passing Math & Reading
       
•Math Scores by Grade Level 

Create a table that list the average Math Score for students in each grade level (9th Grade, 10th Grade, 11th Grade, 12th Grade) at each school
       
•Reading Scores by Grade Level 

Create a table that list the average Reading Score for students in each grade level (9th Grade, 10th Grade, 11th Grade, 12th Grade) at each school
    
•Scores by School Spending

Create a table that list school performances based on average Spending Ranges (per Student) in the area of: Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Student’s Passing Math, % Student’s Passing Reading, % Students Passing Math & Reading
    
•Scores by School Size

Create a table that list school performances based on school size in the area of: Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Student’s Passing Math, % Student’s Passing Reading, % Students Passing Math & Reading
    
•Scores by School Type

Create a table that list school performances based on average Spending Type (Charter vs District) in the area of: Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Student’s Passing Math, % Student’s Passing Reading, % Students Passing Math & Reading
    
    

PyCity Schools Analysis
 
Per the data findings, all students (9th, 10th, 11th and 12th graders) score higher in their reading test than their math test ranging in the 80% percentile. District schools excelled at being the top 5 performing schools. As a result, 90% of students who attends Charter schools scored significantly higher in both reading and math standardized testing than students who attended District schools.
